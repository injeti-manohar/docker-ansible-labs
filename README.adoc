== Ansible Lab Environment using Docker

A lightweight Centos based Ansible Lab using Docker. Creates a Docker centos
container running `systemd` and `ssh` with a vagrant user and passwordless sudo.

Ideal for a Ansible container based lab fully configured with localhost to
container networking. *Not Ideal* for *Production*.

You get:

* A bastion host/jumpbox 
* An arbritrary number of centos/ssh containers
** by default using user vagrant and vagrant insecure key
* A lab directory containing your:
** inventory file: `hosts`
** pre-configured `ansible.cfg` (inventory and ssh)
** ssh directory: with insecure vagrant key and 2 ssh.cfg files 
* ssh access is automatically created and supports:
** direct, via port mapping, default setup via `ssh.cfg`
** via jumphost 1st docker container using `ssh-jumphost.cfg`
* docker utilities aliases automatically created
* `source utilities/docker_aliases.env` creates:
** lab-stop (via `docker stop` container names`)
** lab-destroy (via `docker rm container names`) 

=== TODO
* Write a cleaner ssh template
** Use `Match User`

=== blueprints directory
Contains example configurations. These can be consumed:
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook main.yml -e @blueprints/flask_2_tier_vars.yml

== Usage and Workflow

. Define your lab in `lab_vars.yml`
. `ansible-playbook main.yml`
. That's it `labs/` contains:
[source,bash]
----
lab
├── ansible.cfg
├── hosts
├── ssh
│   ├── insecure_private_key
│   ├── ssh-jumpbox.cfg
│   └── ssh.cfg
└── utilities
    └── docker_aliases.env
----


All access assumes localhost is the control node and has the necessary ssh
key(s). By default it uses vagrant insecure key and connects via `ssh/ssh.cfg`
which automatically uses port mapping. i.e. all targets are access via
locahost:port.

If you prefer to use the first container as an ssh jumphost an alternative ssh
confiration files, `ssh-jumphost.cfg` is automatically generated and can be
pointed to via ansible.cfg

NOTE: the bastion host does *not* have a copy of this key so all `ssh` access is
via 

NOTE: The auto generated `ssh.cfg` uses ProxyJump in preference to ProxyCommand.
This is a much cleaner syntax but if you are running a version of `ssh` prior to
`OpenSSH 7.3`:
* Seriously think about upgrading!
* Use ProxyCommand instead, something like...
[source,bash]
----
ProxyCommand ssh vagrant@bastion -W %h:%p
----

== ssh access

`ssh` access is simple:
[source,bash]
----
lab $ ssh -F ssh/ssh.cfg <container-name>
----

== Requirements
[source,bash]
----
docker-py
libselinux-python # For systems that have SELinux enabled such as Fedora, RHEL, and Centos
----

== Known Limitations

In order to run the playbook in a Python virtualenv in a system that has SELinux enabled,
the virtualenv must be created with the `--system-site-packages` option to enable
access to the global site-packages directory where the `libselinux-python` is installed.
Example:
[source,bash]
----
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages <venv_name>
----

or, if using `virtualenvwrapper`:
[source,bash]
----
$ mkvirtualenv --system-site-packages <venv_name>
----
