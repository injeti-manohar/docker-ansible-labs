== Ansible Lab using Docker

Simple labs using docker and provisioned by Ansible for Ansible

First container, `bastion` acts as a jumphost and includes pre-configured ssh.cfg

=== Overview

Labs come up with `ansible-playbook main.yml`
The Dockerfile is there as a courtesy and is not used.
Still a work in progress - including this readme!

== TODO

* setup a dynamic inventory?
* add a  simple mount point?
